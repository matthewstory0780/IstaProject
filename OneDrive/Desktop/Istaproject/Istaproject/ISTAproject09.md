Project 09

Requirements: The requirements for my project are a database can be linked to a gui perhaps through a cloud application. The gui would need to be aesthetically pleasing and provide users with a streamlined method for input their physical attributes as well as their daily nutritional and workout information. These input would be stored on a database. Additionally the gui needs to provide feedback as far as recommendations and imbalances in the users lifestyle.

Analysis/design: As I mentioned the design would be a gui linked to a database of relevant user information regarding their activity and diet. In addition, this app would be much more user friendly if it could be accessed via mobile device. The key concept of this idea is to make a fitness app that is easy to access anywhere and anytime. The gui should be simple while the database contains the monotonous analysis of the persons data. The gui would then provide lifestyle recommendations as far as a meal plan for that day based on that days activity and a workout for the day.

Implementation:  The implementation of this idea would involve building the actual database using SQL and coding the gui. The bulk of this phase would involve create a gui that is both functional and visually appealing. Since this is where the actual coding takes place it will most likely be the longest and most difficult step of the process. The key to success in this phase would be dividing up the work into modules instead of attacking it all at once.

Testing: In order to make sure that the application does what its supposed to do and runs properly, I would test it by using it in my everyday life. Because fitness is something I pay close attention to, I would make a good guinee pig for the testing of this application. I could also have someone of my friends try the app to discover any issues that might arise.
